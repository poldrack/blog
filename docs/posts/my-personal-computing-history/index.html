<p><em>This was originally posted on blogger <a href="https://russpoldrack.blogspot.com/2010/11/my-personal-computing-history.html">here</a></em>.</p>
<p>My generation may be the last to ever have known a world without ubiquitous computing. It’s now almost impossible to imagine a computer being a thing that sits in the corner at the school library and gets used only by a few geeky kids, but in my high school that’s exactly what it was. I’ve recently been trying to reconstruct the history of different computers that I played with and owned back in those days; here is my first pass at a personal computing history, helped in large part by the awesome amount of computer history information that’s available online.My first exposure to computers came during 1981-1983 when I was in high school, though several different paths (the order of which is slightly hazy me at this point). The first system that I remember programming on was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_TI-99/4A">TI 99/4A</a>, which was a “home computer” released in 1981 (we probably got it around 1982-1983). It came with relatively little software, but I do remember playing a number of games including “TI Invaders” which was their clone of the Space Invaders game. The programs were released on cartridges, more like a video game system than a personal computer. The machine came installed with “TI BASIC” which was a pretty rudimentary version of BASIC. We didn’t have a hard drive, but it was possible to save programs to cassette tape. I don’t remember much about what kind of programming I did on this system, though I’m pretty sure it was all text-based. Northstar AdvantageAround the same time, my father purchased a computer for his accounting office, back when this was just becoming common. It was a <a href="http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=652">Northstar Advantage</a>, which was resold with a GBC logo. This machine was released in 1982, right after the release of the first IBM PC. It ran an operating system called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M">CP/M</a>, which was similar to but predated Microsoft’s DOS. The apps that I remember using included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar">WordStar</a> (word processing) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase">dBASE</a> (a database program). I don’t think I actually programmed on this system, but it was my first experience with command line interfaces (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Interchange_Program">PIP</a>, anyone?). Apple IIeIn our high school there was an <a href="http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=83">Apple IIe</a> in the library that was almost always free. I was ostensibly on the tennis team when I was a senior in high school, but given that I wasn’t very good at tennis, the coach was happy to let me go to the library and play with the computer instead. This system had a great advantage over the TI at home, which was that I could save programs to 5 ¼” floppy disk. This is the first machine that I remember doing any graphics programming on, though I’m sure that it was incredibly rudimentary. In the summers of 1984 and 1985, I worked at a local bank helping them to automate some of their records. The bank had just recently purchased a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer/AT">IBM PC/AT</a> which was the second generation of IBM PC’s. It had such amazing features as 16 MB of RAM and a 20 MB hard drive. I primarily used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_1-2-3">Lotus 1-2-3</a>(an early spreadsheet program). However, in the moments between real work, I would also take advantage of the machine’s modem to dial into a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS sites</a>. It’s hard for me to remember exactly what I found on these sites or how I even found out about them, but it was basically like a very earlier version of the web that one could call into for free. I think I mostly used them to download software. Macintosh SE/30During most of my college career I did not have my own computer; very few students did. If we needed one, we would go to the computer lab on campus, which is where I was introduced to Macintosh (Plus or SE) computers. In my senior year of college the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE/30">Mac SE/30</a> was released, and my parents were nice enough to plop down several thousand dollars to buy me one before I headed off to graduate school, along with an ImageWriter II dot-matrix printer. This machine was my workhorse throughout graduate school. I addition to writing papers, I was my platform for learning other languages including PASCAL and C. It was the system on which I wrote my first simulations, which would be published <a href="http://www.poldracklab.org/Publications/pdfs/Psychonomic%20Bulletin%20and%20Review%201996%20Poldrack.pdf">here</a> (though the actual simulations for that paper were run on a Sun UNIX system at the Beckman Institute because it was so much faster than my SE/30). PowerTower ProWhen I arrived at Stanford for my postdoc in 1995, it was definitely time to upgrade. I was lucky enough to be in the market during the short period in which Mac clones were available, and I bought a <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/powercc/powertower_pro/powertower_pro180.html">Power Computing Power Tower Pro</a>, which was one of my favorite computers ever. It was this machine on which I first started playing serious with Linux (using mkLinux IIRC). The PowerTower Pro is the last machine that I’ve owned that I think could be legitimately called “historical”, so that’s where my story ends for now.</p>

<p>I remember the SE/30–I came over and spent the day at the Nutty Pecan putting my history paper together. (I got an A on it with the comment "Pretty good" from the prof.) Good times.</p>
<p><strong>Unknown said on 2010-11-21</strong></p>
<p>In 1993 you asked me if you should buy a computer or go to Europe. I told you computers were like sex – you shouldn’t have to pay for them. You came to Europe…</p>

<p>That was great advice Gordon!</p>
