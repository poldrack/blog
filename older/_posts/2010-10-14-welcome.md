I've set up this personal site so I will have a place to spout off about the various things that I think about that don't fall under the purview of the my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/russell-poldrack">Huffington Post blog</a>&nbsp;(which is focused on implications of research for daily living) or the&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.cognitiveatlas.org/">Cognitive Atlas blog</a>&nbsp;(which is focused on topics related to our <a href="http://www.cognitiveatlas.org/">Cognitive Atlas project</a>). &nbsp;I will probably focus mostly on science issues, productivity tools and workflows, and food and travel.
