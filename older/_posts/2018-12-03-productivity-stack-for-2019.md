And will happen again. If you can afford to have a second laptop I would strongly suggest keeping a hot spare in the wings. <br /></span></span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1"><span>I don’t have a separate desktop system in my office - when I’m there I just plug into a larger monitor and work from my laptop. In the past I had separate desktop and laptop systems but just found it too easy for things to get desynchronized. <br /></span></span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1"><span>Pro Tip: About once a month I run the <a href="https://www.titanium-software.fr/en/onyx.html">Onyx</a> maintenance scripts, run the DiskUtility file system repair, and clone my entire system to a lightweight 1TB external drive (encrypted, of course) using <a href="https://bombich.com/">CarbonCopyCloner</a>. &nbsp;Having a full disk backup in my backpack has saved me on a few occasions when things went wrong while traveling. <br /></span></span></li></ul><div class="p2"><span><span class="s1"></span><br /></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><span>Mobile: Pixel 2 + Google Fi<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></span></div><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1"><span>I left the iPhone more than a year ago now and have not looked back. &nbsp;The Pixel 2 is great and Google Fi wireless service is awesome, particularly if you travel a lot internationally, since data costs the same almost everywhere on earth. &nbsp;If you want to sign up, use my <a href="https://g.co/fi/r/AK7CTU">referral link</a> and you’ll get a $20 credit (full disclosure - I will get a $100 credit).<br /></span></span></li></ul><div class="p2"><span><span class="s1"></span><br /></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><span>Email: Gmail&nbsp;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></span></div><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1"><span>For many years I used the Mac Mail.app client, but as it became increasingly crappy I finally gave up and moved to the GMail web client, which has been great. &nbsp;The segregation of promotion and social emails, and new features like nudges, make it a really awesome mail client. &nbsp; <br /></span></span></li><li class="li1"><span class="s1"><span>My email workflow is a lazy adaptation of the GTD system: I try not to leave anything in my inbox for more than a day or so (unless I’m traveling). &nbsp;I either act on it immediately, decide to ignore/delete it, or put it straight into my todo list (and archive the message so it’s no longer in my inbox). &nbsp;I’m rarely at inbox zero, but I usually manage to keep it at 25 or fewer messages, so I can see it all in a single screen. <br /></span></span></li></ul><div class="p2"><span><span class="s1"></span><br /></span></div><div class="p1"><span class="s1"><span>To do list: Todoist<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span></span></div><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1"><span class="s1"><span>I moved to <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> a couple of years ago and have been very happy with it.

I actually have considerable overlap with your schema, but have not been able to give up the clone lab yet. There's no way I could match your productivity without it.

Advice on productivity stacking one's brain? ;)

**Unknown said on 2018-12-03**

Ahhh, the mistake when abandoning the Mac was going to Windows. Try a Linux distribution like Ubuntu.

This is great - wish more people would lay out there cohesive &quot;productivity stacks&quot;. As a new grad student I really felt like I was trying to reinvent the wheel and lost a lot of time adopting and discarding inefficient workflows. <br /><br />However, what I would also be really interested to know is how you organize your daily/weekly/monthly/yearly schedule? How do you divide your work/teaching/personal life? And what tips might you have for graduate students in that regard? <br /><br />Thanks for the blog!
