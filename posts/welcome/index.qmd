I've set up this personal site so I will have a place to spout off about the various things that I think about that don't fall under the purview of the my [Huffington Post blog](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/russell-poldrack) (which is focused on implications of research for daily living) or the [Cognitive Atlas blog](http://blog.cognitiveatlas.org/) (which is focused on topics related to our [Cognitive Atlas project](http://www.cognitiveatlas.org/)).  I will probably focus mostly on science issues, productivity tools and workflows, and food and travel.
