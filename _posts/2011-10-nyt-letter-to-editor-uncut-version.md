The NY Times has now printed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/opinion/the-iphone-and-the-brain.html">our letter to the editor</a> regarding the Lindstrom article. &nbsp;However, the published version is an edited and shortened version of our original letter, which I am posting here for the record.<br /><br /><br />Dear Editor,<br />The Op-Ed “You Love Your iPhone, Literally” by Martin Lindstrom purports to show, using brain imaging, that our attachment to digital devices, reflects not addiction but instead the same kind of emotion that we feel for human loved ones. However, the evidence the author presents does not show this. &nbsp;The region that he points to as being “associated with feelings of love and compassion” (the insular cortex) is a brain region that is active in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v8/n8/full/nmeth.1635.html">as many as one third of all brain imaging studies</a>. &nbsp;Further, in studies of decision making the insula is more often associated with negative than positive emotions. &nbsp;The kind of reasoning that Lindstrom uses is well known to be flawed, because there is rarely a one-to-one mapping between any brain region and a single mental state; insula activity could reflect one or more of several psychological processes. This same point <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/opinion/lweb14brain.html">was made by some of us</a>&nbsp;regarding a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/11/opinion/11freedman.html)">similar Op-Ed piece in 2007</a>. <br />We are disappointed that the Times has published extravagant claims based on scientific data that have not been subjected to the standard scientific review process, especially considering how often its pages exhort policy makers to pay more attention to peer-reviewed scientific evidence and disregard specious claims.<br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Russell Poldrack, Ph.D., University of Texas at Austin<br />Geoffrey K Aguirre, M.D., Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania<br />Adam Aron, Ph.D., University of California at San Diego<br />Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., Northeastern University<br />Mark G.
