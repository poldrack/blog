title: Scam journals will literally publish crap

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](http://www.russpoldrack.org/2016/05/scam-journals-will-literally-publish.html)*.

<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px;">In the last couple of years, researchers have started to experience an onslaught of invitations to attend scam conferences and submit papers to scam journals. &nbsp;Many of these seem to emanate from the OMICS group of Henderson, NV and its various subsidiaries. &nbsp;A couple of months ago I decided to start trolling these scammers, just to see if I could get a reaction. &nbsp;After sending many of these, I finally got a response yesterday, which speaks to the complete lack of quality of these journals. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px;">This was the solicitation:</span><br /><div style="font-size: 14px;"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 12px;">On May 20, 2016, at 12:55 AM, Abnormal and Behavioural Psychology &lt;</span><a href="mailto:behaviouralpsychol@omicsinc.com" style="font-size: 12px;">behaviouralpsychol@omicsinc.com</a><span style="font-size: 12px;">&gt; wrote:</span>&nbsp;</span></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="color: #1d2129;">Dear Dr. Russell A.

The paper does not include any text; it is composed entirely of photos of my bowel movements taken every morning for one year. Please let me know if your journal has the capability to publish such a paper; I have found that many other journals are not interested.<br />Sincerely,<br />Russell Poldrack<span style="font-size: 14px;"><br /></span></span></blockquote></div><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px;">Within 12 hours, I had a response:</span><br />  <blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: inherit;">From: Abnormal and Behavioural Psychology &lt;behaviouralpsychol@omicsinc.com&gt;<br />Subject: RE: Appreciated your Excellent Research work<br />Date: May 20, 2016 at 9:47:28 PM PDT<br />To: "'Russell Alan Poldrack'" &lt;russpold@stanford.edu&gt;<br />Dear Dr. Russell A.

I received one this morning from Anna Watson. Then I googled this name and the Journal name Advances in Automobile engineering. On the Journal's website, I can't find his name, making me feel suspicious. Then I saw your blog. Thanks, Russ!<br />
