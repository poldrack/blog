title: Editing lecture videos using Davinci Resolve
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](http://www.russpoldrack.org/2020/11/editing-lecture-videos-using-davinci.html)*.

<p>In my previous post I described a simple workflow for generating lecture videos.&nbsp; One limitation of this workflow is that when slides are shared as a virtual background in Zoom (which I like to do in order to keep my webcam image on the screen next to the slides), the cursor is not captured in the video recording.&nbsp; Since I occasionally need to highlight a portion of the image, this means that I need to edit the video files to add that highlighting.&nbsp; To do this I decided to use <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/">DaVinci Resolve</a>&nbsp;16, which is a powerful video editing tool that is available for free.&nbsp; It has a bit of a learning curve, but the power appears to be well worth it; here I will show my workflow for adding annotations to a lecture video.&nbsp; I'm mostly doing this so that I remember how to do it next time around, but hopefully it might also be useful for others.</p><p>In this example I am discussing Z-scores, and I want to highlight the location of the Z = 0 (i.e. the mean) and Z =1 (one standard deviation) on the normal distribution.&nbsp; After opening DaVinci Resolve, I start a new project for my video, which will open a browser for the media in my project.&nbsp; I then import my lecture video using File -&gt; Import File -&gt;&nbsp; Import Media; it will ask whether you want to change the video settings to match the current project, which I accept.&nbsp; The video will now appear in the media browser in the top left; drag the video onto the timeline browser in the lower leftmost portion of the screen, which will add it to your timeline.&nbsp; Now go to the "Edit" window by clicking the Edit button at the bottom (third icon from the left).&nbsp; Now you will see your video in the timeline at the bottom, along with a preview window at the top:</p><p><br /></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kUzjmUGXcpo/X8PSkllkhSI/AAAAAAAANig/F-lRBFhf1XQtsIpQ46k6dWfIvpHS0cfVwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="480" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kUzjmUGXcpo/X8PSkllkhSI/AAAAAAAANig/F-lRBFhf1XQtsIpQ46k6dWfIvpHS0cfVwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h480/image.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />Now let's add our annotation. First, find the location in the video where you want to add the annotation.&nbsp; Then, right click in the area just to the left of the timeline, and add a new track:<p></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UAOQrrbrEmI/X8PTEPtrzlI/AAAAAAAANio/aVaMTp22Z7UEC5qFZJTxvUkglPwYGDrgACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="476" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UAOQrrbrEmI/X8PTEPtrzlI/AAAAAAAANio/aVaMTp22Z7UEC5qFZJTxvUkglPwYGDrgACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h476/image.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />Now open the Effects library using the tab at the top of the screen (if it's not already open), and navigate to the Effects panel under the Toolbox option.&nbsp; You should see an option for "Adjustment&nbsp; Clip" - grab this and drag it to the location on your video that you had identified.<p></p><p><br /></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hDK8_oRQmqQ/X8PTin9oF7I/AAAAAAAANiw/6HDdhiFm_eQwInNhc5gc4tWL-CzzsUzGgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="480" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hDK8_oRQmqQ/X8PTin9oF7I/AAAAAAAANiw/6HDdhiFm_eQwInNhc5gc4tWL-CzzsUzGgCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h480/image.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />Then, select and right click on the Adjustment Clip that was just created, and choose "Open in Fusion Page":<p></p><p><br /></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CtlwlDuLsP8/X8PT1c9gqNI/AAAAAAAANi4/lX_Ei40KMSkv49PvLjUiUZDjcnDEpYW2wCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="332" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CtlwlDuLsP8/X8PT1c9gqNI/AAAAAAAANi4/lX_Ei40KMSkv49PvLjUiUZDjcnDEpYW2wCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h332/image.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />This will open the Fusion editor, which is a powerful tool for all sorts of video edits.&nbsp; You will see a section in the bottom left showing two nodes for MediaIn1 and MediaOut1; what you need to do is add a Paint node into the line connecting those nodes, which you can do by right-clicking onto the line and Adding a Paint tool node:<p></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dAbai57dF6A/X8PU2miAcxI/AAAAAAAANjE/HKLNsfJWOEAB93nVU2S13faZOWC5lcbRwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="469" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dAbai57dF6A/X8PU2miAcxI/AAAAAAAANjE/HKLNsfJWOEAB93nVU2S13faZOWC5lcbRwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h469/image.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />You will now see details about the Paint tool in the inspector to the top right.&nbsp; Here is perhaps the most important thing to know here:&nbsp; The tool that is opened by default (the "Multistroke" tool) doesn't do what we want it to do here, which is to create a graphic that remains on the screen for the length of our Adjustment clip.&nbsp; To do that, select the simple "Stroke" tool, which for me is the fourth icon in the panel above the preview:<p></p><p><br /></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_xHHWPqMzow/X8PVtu_1VyI/AAAAAAAANjM/lAfYL2oUSHwO1m8qeCUKXttdx9xZO27iACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="466" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_xHHWPqMzow/X8PVtu_1VyI/AAAAAAAANjM/lAfYL2oUSHwO1m8qeCUKXttdx9xZO27iACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h466/image.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />You should then see a set of controls for Stroke1 in the Inspector to the top right:<p></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-t1v02GbvyXs/X8PWARy5otI/AAAAAAAANjU/kNCZ0TSrUr8tEncpEDwSEovKTe5obMpUQCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="400" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-t1v02GbvyXs/X8PWARy5otI/AAAAAAAANjU/kNCZ0TSrUr8tEncpEDwSEovKTe5obMpUQCLcBGAsYHQ/w223-h400/image.png" width="223" /></a></div><br />Choose the color for your annotation along with changing any other features of interest; I will use a red painbrush, so I click on the color chooser and pick a red color.&nbsp; Then you simply start painting in the preview window:<p></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uU15RiHlMYE/X8PWY9oErfI/AAAAAAAANjc/UGX5aAwzGPE-PY_IpkckwKNo0atfRkDwgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="478" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uU15RiHlMYE/X8PWY9oErfI/AAAAAAAANjc/UGX5aAwzGPE-PY_IpkckwKNo0atfRkDwgCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h478/image.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />Now go back to the editing window, and adjust the length of the Adjustment Clip as needed for your video.&nbsp; You can add as many additional annotations as needed using this same method.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p><p>Occasionally I realize that I have said something incorrect in the video. Rather than re-recording or trying to edit the video itself, I simply add a title to the screen nothing that I misspoke. This is easy using the Title feature from the Effects library in the editing page:</p><p><br /></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CKmuJBJs1dQ/X8PcPywTdUI/AAAAAAAANjo/qbqLQ2yHH9UdDjyIsVlPFx-bncj9KNduwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img alt="" height="430" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-CKmuJBJs1dQ/X8PcPywTdUI/AAAAAAAANjo/qbqLQ2yHH9UdDjyIsVlPFx-bncj9KNduwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h430/image.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><p></p><p>Once you are done, simply export the video using the QuickExport feature and you are ready to go!</p><p><br /></p>
