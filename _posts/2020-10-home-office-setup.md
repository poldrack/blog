title: Home office setup
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](http://www.russpoldrack.org/2020/10/home-office-setup.html)*.

<p>One of my colleagues recently asked me about my home office setup, after noting that my video and audio quality is generally quite good on our frequent Zoom calls. &nbsp;Whenever anyone asks me a question like this, I take it as a good excuse to write a blog post!</p><!--?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?--> <div>We have all spent a lot of time in our home offices since March, and I’m lucky that we have a guest bedroom that I was able to repurpose as my home office. &nbsp;I’ve ended up spending a bit of money to make it nice, but I think in general the investments have been good. &nbsp;However, I’ve also gone cheap/DIY when I can. &nbsp;Here is a photo of my desk setup:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wo43hBT5-P4/X4YUZc8VIlI/AAAAAAAANYU/Gaxc02aJ3NY0EnmncRX4PpIrioSxiTmrQCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/2020-10-13%2B11.27.23.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wo43hBT5-P4/X4YUZc8VIlI/AAAAAAAANYU/Gaxc02aJ3NY0EnmncRX4PpIrioSxiTmrQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/2020-10-13%2B11.27.23.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Here’s a quick rundown of the various items:</div><ol><li>Camera: Logitech C930e </li><li>Microphone:&nbsp;Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB with&nbsp;Sterling Audio Sterling SM5 Shock Mount </li><li>Pop Filter: Stedman Proscreen XL </li><li>Mic boom:&nbsp;Rode PSA1 </li><li>Headphones (over-ear):&nbsp;Audio-Technica ATH-AD700X Open-air </li><li>Headphones (in-ear): Apple AirPods </li><li>Lighting: Homemade diffusers with Cree 5000K LED bulbs </li><li>Green screen: Homemade </li><li>Chair: Steelcase Leap</li></ol><div><i>Camera</i>: This webcam was scavenged from my lab at the beginning of the pandemic, back when it was impossible to find a webcam in stock for purchase. &nbsp;It works fine, though I wouldn't say that the picture quality is amazing. &nbsp;After seeing one of my colleagues get amazing video quality by using their DSLR as a webcam, I tried it out with our relatively ancient Canon Rebel - the color was much better but its video was way too laggy, and the camera/tripod setup took up too much room on my desk, so I’ve stuck with the Logitech. &nbsp;I use the Webcam Settings App for Mac to zoom the image so that my head takes up most of the image without having to lean into the camera. </div><div><br /></div><div><i>Microphone setup</i>: &nbsp;I wanted to get a boom mic rather than a stand mic, mostly because I didn’t want a stand mic taking up extra space on my desktop. &nbsp;I know that many people use either a lapel mic or a mic integrated into their headset, but neither of those sounded attractive to me. &nbsp;The microphone connects via USB to my computer, and works really well. I went for a nicer mic in part because I was planning to record an audio version of my statistics book to provide to my students, and I’ve been really happy with the sound quality. &nbsp;The shock mount does a good job of isolating low-frequency noise from the desk, though a tiny bit of keyboard noise is evident when I’m typing, even with the mic pointed directly away from the keyboard. &nbsp;The Rode mic stand can sometimes be difficult to keep in position, but works fine for my purposes. &nbsp;I don’t use the popscreen for Zoom calls, but it has been important for recording spoken word material, which otherwise sounds like I’m spitting on the listener. </div><div><br /></div><div><i>Headphones</i>: I generally alternate between in-ear and over-ear headphones over the day. &nbsp;I love the AirPods, but after a while they start hurting my ears, and they don’t have enough battery life to get me through a full day of Zoom meetings. &nbsp;The Audio-Technica headphones were my first open-back headphones, and I am definitely a convert - they let you hear the outside world, and don’t leave you with that closed-in feel that you get from closed-back headphones. &nbsp;They are also super comfortable. &nbsp;These are standard wired headphones, which I like both because they don’t have a lag like bluetooth headphones (not so important for Zoom calls but essential when I’m playing guitar), and also because I will never be stuck with a dead battery. </div><div><br /></div><div><i>Lighting</i>: Everything else involved buying some equipment, so for the lighting setup I decided to go DIY (with lots of help and encouragement from my designer/wife Jen). &nbsp;I wanted a simple two-point lighting setup from the two sides of my monitor, so we started with a couple of old table lamps that we had around the house. &nbsp;I took a couple of empty wooden picture frames and attached each one to one of the arms of the lamp using a plastic cable stay, which is not exactly bulletproof but so far as lasted several months without failing. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jvQ8Az3CPyE/X4YYOtlGZOI/AAAAAAAANYw/6mGFxSQWumY93aDCZ4FRfk35jC7vR28vwCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/2020-10-13%2B12.49.52.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jvQ8Az3CPyE/X4YYOtlGZOI/AAAAAAAANYw/6mGFxSQWumY93aDCZ4FRfk35jC7vR28vwCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h240/2020-10-13%2B12.49.52.jpg" title="Closeup of homemade lighting system" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>To create a diffuser I started with some architectural tracing paper which I affixed in a sleeve around the picture frames. &nbsp;ultimately this wasn’t quite enough diffusion (I was still seeing strong reflections of the light in my glasses), so I also attached a piece of standard printer paper to the front with a binder clip.&nbsp; I still get a bit of point glare, but it’s not too bad:</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w8v9hxfxA2Y/X4YUnUQtfQI/AAAAAAAANYY/elpOOT0ZsJI0VjQHNdY4MCUCyu49mbdagCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/zoom_shot.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w8v9hxfxA2Y/X4YUnUQtfQI/AAAAAAAANYY/elpOOT0ZsJI0VjQHNdY4MCUCyu49mbdagCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/zoom_shot.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div>I'll probably try to do some more tweaking to resolve that.&nbsp; We started with some warmer bulbs but I didn’t love the color, so I replaced them with Cree 5000K LED bulbs which I’m pretty happy with.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Green screen</i>: I don’t usually use a green screen, but sometimes I need it if I want to play with video editing software for lecture videos. This one is also DIY - basically a wheeled clothing rack with a green fleece blanket attached using some large binder clips.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zgrgxouTdmo/X4YU0_v3OzI/AAAAAAAANYg/f-uo9l3v4QUVKY350StbrCV-YuQmztiuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/2020-10-13%2B13.50.25.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zgrgxouTdmo/X4YU0_v3OzI/AAAAAAAANYg/f-uo9l3v4QUVKY350StbrCV-YuQmztiuQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/2020-10-13%2B13.50.25.jpg" /></a></div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Definitely not pretty, but gets the job done. </div><div><br /></div><div><i>Chair</i>: After spending the first few months of quarantine sitting in a cheapo office chair (and feeling the effects by the end of the day), I decided to splurge on a serious office chair. I already had a Steelcase Leap in my campus office, so I knew I would be happy with it. It has not disappointed - it’s definitely not cheap, but if you need a really good chair and have the budget I would definitely recommend it. Your butt will thank you! </div><div><br /></div><div>I'm interested to hear your thoughts and any tips on how to further optimize the setup.</div>

Russ, Love your setup. Being retired now, I am especially interested in your water/wine glass with what looks like a silicon protector sleeve. Where did you get that?
