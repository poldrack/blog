title: On "healthy choices"
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](http://www.russpoldrack.org/2013/04/on-healthy-choices.html)*.

<br /><div class="p1">This week, I received an email describing new nutritional recommendations at one of the campus eateries:</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">Please come by O's Campus Cafe over the next few weeks to see how they are making healthy eating easier!<br />O's Campus Cafe has analyzed their menu and labeled their foods in order to make it easier for you to make the healthiest choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;All foods have been given a red, yellow, or green rating based on how nutrient dense they are. Foods that have received a "Red" rating have very little positive nutrient content, are higher in unhealthy nutrients, and should be consumed minimally.&nbsp;&nbsp;Foods that have received a "Yellow" rating have some positive nutrient content, some unhealthy nutrients, and should be consumed less often.&nbsp;&nbsp;Foods that have received a "Green" are high in positive nutrient content, have little to no unhealthy nutrients, and can be consumed frequently.&nbsp;&nbsp;The healthy nutrients evaluated in these developing these ratings are protein, fiber, unsaturated fat, vitamins A, C, E, B-12, thiamin, riboflavin, and folate, and minerals calcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium.&nbsp;&nbsp;The nutrients considered unhealthy are saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.&nbsp;</blockquote><div class="p3">I would hope that guidelines regarding "healthy" choices at a major research university would be backed up with evidence, but it turns out that they were simply based on an off-the-shelf rating system (the<a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/139/8/1549.abstract"> Nutrient Rich Food Index</a>). To see whether they are supported by actual evidence, I used PubMed to look for relevant results from randomized controlled trials; I avoided epidemiological studies given all of the difficulties in making solid conclusions from nutritional epidemiology research (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/magazine/16epidemiology-t.html?oref=login"><span class="s1">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/magazine/16epidemiology-t.html</span></a>). Here is what I found regarding the supposedly "unhealthy" nutrients:</div><div class="p3"></div><ul><li>Reduction of saturated fat intake was associated with reduced cardiovascular events but not with any changes in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22592684"><span class="s1">Hooper et al., 2012</span></a><span class="s2">).</span>&nbsp;A nice review of lipid metabolism by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163782707000549"><span class="s1">Lands (2008)</span></a><span class="s2">&nbsp;</span>highlights how the search for mechanisms by which saturated fats might be harmful has failed: "<span class="s3">Fifty years later [after starting his research in the 1960's], I still cannot cite a definite mechanism or mediator by which saturated fat is shown to kill people."</span></li></ul><br /> <div class="p3"></div><ul><li>A review of the effects of dietary sodium reduction in randomized controlled trials showed "no strong evidence of any effect of salt reduction" on all-cause mortality (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21735439"><span class="s1">Taylor et al., 2011</span></a><span class="s2">).</span></li></ul><ul><li>I searched deeply on PubMed but was unable to find any systematic reviews of the effects of dietary cholesterol reduction on mortality (please let me know if you know of any); there are lots of studies looking at cholesterol reduction using statins, but that doesn't really inform the question of dietary cholesterol reduction. &nbsp;However, given that serum cholesterol levels bear very little relation to dietary cholesterol intake (<a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/2/5/696.full.pdf"><span class="s1">Gertler et al., 1950</span></a><span class="s2">), the labeling of dietary cholesterol as "unhealthy" seems unsupported by evidence.</span>&nbsp;</li></ul><br /> <div class="p3">The first two reviews listed above come from the Cochrane Collaboration, which is generally viewed as a highly objective source for systematic reviews in evidence-based medicine.</div><div class="p3"><br /></div><div class="p3"><i>What about the supposed "healthy" choices?</i></div><div class="p4"><br /></div><div class="p3">I also looked for data relevant to the the health benefits of the supposedly healthy choices:</div><div class="p3"></div><ul><li>A recent report from a randomized controlled trial showed that replacement of saturated fats with omega-6 linoleic acid (an unsaturated, and thus "healthy" fat) was associated with <i>increased</i>, rather than decreased all-cause mortality (<span class="s1"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23386268">Ramsden et al., 2013</a>).&nbsp;</span>This makes sense given the association of omega-6 fatty acids with inflammation (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3475243/"><span class="s4">Lands, 2012</span></a>)&nbsp;&nbsp;and the powerful role that inflammation plays in many diseases.</li></ul><br /> <div class="p1"></div><ul><li>Increased fiber intake in the DART (diet and reinfarction trial) of individuals who had already suffered a heart attack was associated with no effects on all-cause mortality after 10 years.(<span class="s4"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12032650">Ness et al., 2002</a>). &nbsp;An earlier Cochrane review also showed no effects of fiber intake on incidence or recurrence of colon cancer (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12076480">Asano &amp; McLeod, 2002</a>).</span></li></ul><br /> <div class="p3">I don't claim to be an expert in this domain, but the best evidence available seems to point towards the lack of any scientific validity of these "health" labels. &nbsp;</div><div class="p4"><br /></div><div class="p3"><i>Isn't it better than nothing?</i></div><div class="p4"><br /></div><div class="p3">One might ask whether it's still better to have some guidance that pushes people to try to eat more healthily, even if it's not supported by science. &nbsp;If the recommendations were made with full disclosure of the lack of scientific evidence (ala the disclaimer on dietary supplements) then I would be ok with that. Instead, the recommendations are made in the context of a "nutritionism" that pretends that we will be healthy if we just get the right mix of healthy nutrients and avoid the bad ones, and also pretends to know which are which. &nbsp;I personally would rather have no advice than unsupported pseudoadvice.</div><div class="p4"><br /></div><div class="p3">At the same time, it's clear from the obesity epidemic that people need help in making better food choices, so what should we do instead? &nbsp;I would propose implementing a simple rating system based the first of Michael Pollan's food rules: "Eat food". &nbsp;Anything that has been freshly picked, harvested, or slaughtered would get a "healthy rating" and anything that comes from a box, can, or bag would get an "unhealthy" rating. It would be much easier than computing micronutrient values, and I challenge anyone to show that it would be any less objectively healthy than the proposed "healthy choices" which would label a fresh grass-fed steak as less healthy than a pile of french fries fried in corn oil.</div>

To be fair, can you point to any scientific literature that supports your recommendation to &quot;Eat food&quot;? I imagine you can, but am curious to read some literature that supports what seems common sense to me.

**Russ Poldrack said on 2013-05-20**

fair question - I'm not sure that I can point to any specific research that would support this very general claim.  would be interesting to see a randomized controlled trial that assigned people to eating highly processed vs. unprocessed foods.
